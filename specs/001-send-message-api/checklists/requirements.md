# Specification Quality Checklist: Programmatic Send Message API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**:
- ✓ Spec contains 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) that are independently testable
- ✓ 11 functional requirements clearly define what the system must do
- ✓ 5 success criteria provide measurable outcomes (performance, reliability, usability)
- ✓ 6 edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- ✓ All requirements are written in technology-agnostic language focused on user/business value
- ✓ No clarification markers present - feature is well-defined and ready for technical planning

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
